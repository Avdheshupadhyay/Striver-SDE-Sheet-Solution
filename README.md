## Introduction
The Striver SDE Sheet is a collection of 190+ important problems categorized into topics like Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc. These problems cover all the major concepts that are required to crack coding interviews. I have solved all the problems in the sheet using Java, and this repository contains all my solutions. You can refer to this as a learning resource or to improve your problem-solving skills.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, etc.

## Problem List
The problems are organized into the following categories:
1. Arrays
2. Strings
3. Linked Lists
4. Stacks & Queues
5. Trees
6. Graphs
7. Dynamic Programming
8. Greedy Algorithms
9. Backtracking
10. Bit Manipulation
11. Searching & Sorting
12. Miscellaneous

The solutions are organized by problem category for easy navigation.

## Solution Details
Each solution is stored in a separate file, and the filename corresponds to the problem name or number from the SDE Sheet. The solutions are efficient and follow optimal approaches wherever possible.

## How to Run the Code
